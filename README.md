## Description

This app has been inspired by our desire to maximize our savings.

**Record your transactions.** It is easy to record any transaction. All it needs are the following:
- type (expense or earning)
- amount (price)
- category
  - expense: Food, Transpo, Rent, Unexpected, etc
  - earning: Salary, Bonus, Sideline, others
- (optional) description

**Organize with multiple books.** You can create a record book for each of your bank acounts. With manual recording of your transactions using this organizational scheme, you will have a very good knowledge on how money flows in your accounts.

**Save *locally* or sync *online*.** Because of remotestorage (embedded in the app), your record books are saved locally in your device. If you want to work on multiple devices, you can sync your books online using the remotestorage sync feature.
